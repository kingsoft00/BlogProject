<h3 style="color: orangered"><b>June Forecast Includes Changes in Orange and Grapefruit Crop Production</b><br>
 </h3>
<hr>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 136, 0)"><tab1></tab1><strong>BARTOW</strong> – The National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture projected a decrease for Florida Orange and Grapefruit production, in an announcement Thursday.<br><br>

  <tab1></tab1>The USDA predicted Florida Orange production at 67.65 million boxes, a 2 million box decrease over May’s forecast. Florida Grapefruit production decreased slightly from 4.9 to 4.89 million boxes for the 2019-20 season but remained above the 4.51 million boxes produced in 2018-19. Florida Specialty Citrus remained stable at 1.02 million boxes, an increase over the previous season that ended at 990,000 boxes.<br><br>
  
  “This forecast reflects the natural fluctuations we would expect over the course of a season and contributes to a multi-year trend indicating growers continue to make strides against citrus greening. We are encouraged by year-over-year increases in both grapefruit and specialty citrus production and hope to see similar stability or gains in the orange category soon,” said Shannon Shepp, executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus.<br><br>
